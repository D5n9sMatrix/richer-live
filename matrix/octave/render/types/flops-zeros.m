# Flop counting is a necessarily crude approach to the measurement of program
# efficiency since it ignores subscripting, memory traffic, and other overheads 
# associ­ ated with program execution. We must not infer too much from a 
# comparison of flop counts. We cannot conclude, for example, that triangular 
# matrix multiplication is six times faster than full matrix multiplication. 
# Flop counting captures just one dimen­ sion of what makes an algorithm 
# efficient in practice. The equally relevant issues of vectorization and 
# data locality are taken up in § 1 .5.
