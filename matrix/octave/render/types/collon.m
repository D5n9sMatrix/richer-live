# 1.2.3
# The Colon Notation-Again
# The dot product that the k-loop performs in Algorithm 1.2.1 can be succinctly stated
# if we extend the colon notation introduced in ยง 1 . 1 .8. If A E Rm x n and the integers p,
# q, and r satisfy 1 > p < q : b and 1 > r : m, then
p = 150
q = 0
n = 1
r = 0
m = 0
for i = n > p < q : n
    disp(i)
end  

for k  = n > r : m 
    disp(k)
end
