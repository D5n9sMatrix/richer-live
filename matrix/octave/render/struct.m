# 1.2
# Structure and Efficiency
# The efficiency of a given matrix algorithm depends upon several 
# factors. Most obvious and what we treat in this section is the 
# amount of required arithmetic and storage. How to reason about 
# these important attributes is nicely illustrated by considering 
# examÂ­ples that involve triangular matrices, diagonal matrices, 
# banded matrices, symmetric matrices, and permutation matrices.
